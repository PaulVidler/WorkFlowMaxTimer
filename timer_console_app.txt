Timer console app.

GUI:
- Has start and stop timer.
- Before start or stop. Timer must be allocated to a job or lunch etc.
- Allocation will come from Workflowmax API.
- Perhaps a spot to add your name so there's no confusion over who owns what. (Times getting mixed up etc)
  Should be alright considering each computer will have a different install. 
- Probably run from a tool bar app/icon
- Ability to comment each record
- Button to email on demand
- Maybe a tick-box for lunch timer?
- List times already logged?
- Edit times already logged? Fuck, this is getting more complicated than expected.
- "Paul Vidler" written somewhere on the GUI. It's important that management are subtly reminded of who wrote this, and my goals,
   especially if it goes to Adelaide and get used there! People will use this, even if it's not going to win any innovation awards!

Business:
- Will email structured times and dates on request.
- Will save and draw dates from a text file or similar. No need for a DB. Or is there?
- Will draw allocation data from WorkFlowMax API (See mad-dog)

- Class for "time allocation" - Date, Job, Task, Stop time, Start time, notes properties. (Maybe username seperate?)
  Perhaps should have a 'fortnight' assigned to it? Maybe not necessary?
- Class for "Email". Comprise of "time allocation" objects and parsed into readable format. Email address. Username.
- Class for "WorkFlowMaxJob" objects from WFM API. Only used to populate list boxes

- Start/stop buttons and GUI
- Ability to edit details for any entry. Perhaps even the ability to use the API to upload directly to WF-Max.


Data:
- Saving to text file? Seems too stone age? Maybe get user to chisel in stone tablets before subimtting?
- Probably need the DB practice. But is that reason enough to over engineer?
- Either way, must be able to write/retrieve info on demand



Action list:

- Write classes
- Write basic GUI with start/stop function
- Work out how to send email from GUI
- Decide on data saving to DB or to txt file?
- Oh, that's right, you don't know how to make a GUI..... Learn it!
- More advanced GUI with workflowmax API to pull job list for selection and text space to enter username/email/email buttons.
